                    The task for this assignment was to create a fractal structure similar to the one we created together in the course. For the beginnings I started with adopting the code we created together and extended it with new symbols, to get our line-tree to be 3D. Now I tried to include 3D Geometry into the logic. The existing “snake” is a torus-knot which represents my many trys with different geometrys. While this project is still work in progress, I got it to move my 3D geometry to move to the end of a branch. My final goal would be to create a total 3D structure like the Mandelbrot-Bulb or the Romanesco Broccoli. But for now this project was a great way for understanding the data structure and the handling with fractal geometry generation.

                    Please add the instruction for using the app here. For example in this one, you need to double click on the plane and existing voxel(s) to add a new one.
